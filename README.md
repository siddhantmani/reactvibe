## 👋 About

React Vibe is a **motion-first React component collection** focused on interaction quality, smooth animations, and clean UI patterns.

It’s built for developers who care about **how interfaces feel**, not just how they look.

No black-box abstractions.  
No custom libraries.  
Just well-crafted components you can drop into real projects.

---

## ⭐ Why React Vibe

- **Motion-first by design** — animations are not an afterthought
- **Copy–paste friendly** — full control over the code you ship
- **Built on familiar tools** — Three.js + Framer Motion + Tailwind CSS
- **Production-ready** — designed for landing pages, dashboards, and SaaS apps
- **Easy to customize** — no hidden styling logic

---

## 🧩 Categories

React Vibe includes a growing set of components and sections:

- Backgrounds
- Hero Section
- Sections
- Components
- Text Motion

Each component is designed to be **self-contained, readable, and extensible**.

## 🚀 Usage

React Vibe is **not shipped as a dependency**.

You copy the component code and use it directly in your project.

This keeps:
- Your bundle clean
- Your codebase fully owned by you
- No version-lock or abstraction tax

Most components rely on:
- **Three.js + Framer Motion** for animation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
